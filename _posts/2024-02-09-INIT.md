here it comes.somewhere a little after my totally appropriate bed time, the urge to stream my life or in this case the lack of it.
but don't get used to it for we are in time of change. hopefully this journal is going to be a proof of it. either way i shall keep at it even if it means filing it with substanceless howling.
maybe thats the best way of forcing some action into your life. turning it to entertainment for the masses. and for the masses it shall be. everybody's attention is equal here, i promise there will be something for everyone.      


here is a logo i made i did't know where to put it and im too cheap to not use it so here you go i hope you like it.
